Meteor + Angular Animate - Show issue in urigo/angular-meteor-1.0.0-rc5

This repository was created to show an issue in urigo/angular-meteor-1.0.0-rc5 that is preventing 
Angular Animate (ngAnimate) from adding the ng-enter, ng-exit, etc. classes.

# Reproduce
1. clone this repository
2. cd meteor-angular-animate
3. meteor

When you select items from the drop down, they are supposed to animate, just like it does in the first
example here: https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngSwitch#animations
